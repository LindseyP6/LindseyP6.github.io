        <p>All Cats Are Beautiful is a cat rescuing best-friend duo. We started our journey in March of 2020, noticing several cats outside of our front door. They often seemed to be following our dog, Jack. Well, from there many friendships developed! Working with <a href="www.brooklynanimalaction.com" target="blank">Brooklyn Animal Action</a>, we completed our first TNR in August of that year. In October of 2020, we both became TNR certified. Since then we have trapped over 35 cats, TNRing half of those and adopting out the rest! </p>
